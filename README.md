This package provides an API for parsing from and serialising to yaml.

## Installation

Simply install to your project:

```bash
sampctl package install Southclaws/pawn-yaml
```

Include in your code and begin using the library:

```pawn
#include <yaml>
```

## Usage

It has the same API as [pawn-json](https://github.com/Southclaws/pawn-json) so just read those docs and imagine every instance of "json" replaced with "yaml".
